## Tutorial: The Grid Feature Type

### Scientific Feature Types
The Common Data Model (CDM) Scientific Feature Type layer adds another layer of functionality on top of `NetcdfDataset`, by specializing in various kinds of data that are common in Earth science.
The abstract concepts and concrete classes are continually evolving, and we have concentrated on, for obvious reasons, the types of datasets and data that Unidata is most familiar with, mainly from the atmospheric and ocean sciences.

All Scientific Feature Types have georeferencing coordinate systems, from which a location in real physical space and time can be found, usually with reference to the Earth.
Each adds special data subsetting methods which cannot be done efficiently or at all in the general case of `NetcdfDataset` objects.

The Scientific Feature Type interface is currently undergoing significant change; this page serves as an overview of a conceptual goal, rather than documentation. For more information see the overview of
[Scientific Feature Types.](feature_datasets.html )

### The Grid Feature Type
A `GridCoordSystem` at a minimum has a `Lat` and `Lon` coordinate axis, or a `GeoX` and `GeoY` coordinate axis plus a `Projection` that maps x, y to lat, lon.
It usually has a time coordinate axis. It may optionally have a vertical coordinate axis, classified as `Height`, `Pressure`, or `GeoZ`.
If it is a `GeoZ` axis, it may have a vertical transform that maps `GeoZ` to height or pressure. A `Grid` may also optionally have a `Runtime` and/or `Ensemble` coordinate axis.

A `GridDataset` (aka Grid) has a `GridCoordSystem`, whose dimensions are all connected, meaning that neighbors in index space are connected neighbors in coordinate space.
This means that data values that are close to each other in the real world (coordinate space) are close to each other in the data array, and are usually stored close to each other on disk, making coordinate subsetting easy and efficient.

A `GridDataset` has `Grids` that can be grouped based on common attributes and `GridCoordSystems`. Below is the UML for the Grid interface classes, found in the ucar.nc2.dt package:

### Opening a GridDataset
The most general way to open a `GridDataset` is to use the `FeatureDatasetFactoryManager` class. This allows third parties to plug-in alternative implementations of `GridDataset` at runtime.
For example:

{% capture rmd %}
{% includecodeblock netcdf-java&docs/src/test/java/examples/featuretypes/GridDatasetsTutorial.java&gridDatasetFormat %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ rmd | markdownify }}


If you know that the file you are opening is a `GridDataset`, you can call directly:
{% capture rmd %}
{% includecodeblock netcdf-java&docs/src/test/java/examples/featuretypes/GridDatasetsTutorial.java&gridFormat %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ rmd | markdownify }}

### Using a GridDataset

Once you have a `GridDataset`, you can get the grids and their associated coordinate systems:

{% capture rmd %}
{% includecodeblock netcdf-java&docs/src/test/java/examples/featuretypes/GridDatasetsTutorial.java&usingGridDataset %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ rmd | markdownify }}

A `GridCoordSystem` wraps a georeferencing coordinate system. It always has 1D or 2D `XHoriz` and `YHoriz` axes, and optionally 1D vertical and 1D or 2D time axes.
The `XHoriz/YHoriz` axes will be lat/lon if `isLatLon()` is true, otherwise they will be `GeoX,GeoY` with an appropriate `Projection`.
The `getBoundingBox()` method returns a bounding box from the `XHoriz/YHoriz` corner points. The `getLatLonBoundingBox()` method returns the smallest lat/lon bounding box that contains `getBoundingBox()`.

You can use the `GridCoordSystem` to find the indices and coordinates of the 2D grid from the (x,y) projection point:

{% capture rmd %}
{% includecodeblock netcdf-java&docs/src/test/java/examples/featuretypes/GridDatasetsTutorial.java&findLatLonVal %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ rmd | markdownify }}

Most `GridCoordSystems` have a `CoordinateAxis1DTime` time coordinate. If so, you can get the list of dates from it.

A `GridDatatype` is like a specialized `Variable` that explicitly handles X,Y,Z,T dimensions, which are put into canonical order: (t, z, y, x).
It has various convenience routines that expose methods from the `GridCoordSystem` and `VariableDS` objects.
The main data access method is `readDataSlice()`, where you can fix an index on any `Dimension`, or use a -1 to get all the data in that `Dimension`.

{% capture rmd %}
{% includecodeblock netcdf-java&docs/src/test/java/examples/featuretypes/GridDatasetsTutorial.java&readingData %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ rmd | markdownify }}

The subset method allows you to create a logical subset of a `GeoGrid` using index `Ranges`.

{% capture rmd %}
{% includecodeblock netcdf-java&docs/src/test/java/examples/featuretypes/GridDatasetsTutorial.java&CallMakeSubset %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ rmd | markdownify }}

### Writing a GridDataset to a Netcdf-3 file using CF-1.0 Conventions

Once you have a `GridDataset`, you can write it as a Netcdf-3 file using the <a href="http://cfconventions.org/" target="_blank">CF Conventions</a>, using `ucar.nc2.write.NetcdfFormatWriter`.
See the [Writing CDM](writing_netcdf.html) page for a detailed explanation of writing netCDF-3 and netCDF-4 files.

### Using ToolsUI to look at Grids

You can use ToolsUI **FeatureTypes/Grids** Tab to view `GridDatasets`. This consists of 3 tables that show the `Grid` datatypes, the `GridCoordSystems`, and the coordinate axes:

{% include image.html file="netcdf-java/tutorial/toolsui/toolsUIGrid.png" alt="Grid UI" caption="ToolsUI Interface" %}

Use the {% include inline_image.html file="netcdf-java/tutorial/toolsui/redrawButton.jpg" alt="Redraw button" %}  button to display the grids in the grid viewer window:

{% include image.html file="netcdf-java/tutorial/toolsui/toolsUIGridView.png" alt="Grid View" caption="ToolsUI Grid Viewer" %}
